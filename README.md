Final Project in the course "Coding and Algorithms for Memories"

This project title is "Efficient Synthesis Coding" - we assume that there exists a synthesis machine in which on every cycle it is possible to synthesize
one of two bases and it is possible to choose the bases in each cycle. The goal is to encode a sequence with a small number of redundancy symbols to reduce its worst case number of synthesis cycles
under the synthesis sequence and how to determine the synthesis sequence in order to synthesize together more than two sequences.
